# Advisor Transcript Dialog Implementation

## Summary
Successfully implemented transcript dialog functionality for the advisor feature. When clicking the "View Details" button on a student card in the advisor's MyStudentsPage, it now opens a comprehensive transcript dialog that fetches and displays the student's complete academic transcript with proper student information display.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created TranscriptDialog Component
- **File**: `/src/features/advisor/components/TranscriptDialog.tsx`
- **Features**:
  - Displays student information (name, student number, department, GPA)
  - Shows complete course history in a scrollable table
  - Color-coded grades for easy identification
  - Loading states and error handling
  - Responsive design with modern UI
  - Updated to show "Student Number" instead of "Student ID"

### 2. Updated API Service
- **File**: `/src/features/advisor/services/api/transcriptApi.ts`
- **Implementation**: 
  - `getStudentTranscriptApi()` function now calls the backend endpoint: `/api/coursetakens/by-student/{studentId}`
  - Added student information parameter to properly display student details
  - Transforms API response to match the `TranscriptData` interface
  - Includes proper error handling and authentication
  - Uses maximum page size (2,147,483,647) to fetch all courses

### 3. Modified MyStudentsPage
- **File**: `/src/features/advisor/pages/MyStudentsPage.tsx`
- **Changes**:
  - **Display Updates**: Changed from showing database ID to student number
  - Added transcript-related state management (`transcriptData`, `transcriptLoading`, `transcriptError`)
  - Created `handleViewDetails()` function to fetch transcript data with student information
  - Updated "View Details" button to trigger transcript fetching with student details
  - Replaced basic student info dialog with comprehensive TranscriptDialog component
  - **Search Enhancement**: Updated search to work with student numbers as well as names
  - **Search Label**: Changed from "Search by name or ID" to "Search by name or student number"

### 4. Service Layer Updates
- **File**: `/src/features/advisor/services/index.ts`
- **Changes**:
  - Updated `getStudentTranscript` function signature to accept student information
  - Passes student details to API for proper display in dialog

## API Integration
The implementation correctly calls the backend endpoint:
```
GET /api/coursetakens/by-student/{studentId}?PageRequest.PageSize=2147483647
```

The API response is transformed to match the frontend `TranscriptData` interface:
- `studentInfo`: Contains student name, student number (instead of database ID), and department
- `courses`: Array of course objects with code, name, credits, grade, and semester
- `gpa`: Calculated GPA based on Turkish letter grade system

## User Experience Improvements
1. **Student Number Display**: Users now see meaningful student numbers instead of database IDs
2. **Enhanced Search**: Can search by both student names and student numbers
3. **Proper Student Information**: Dialog shows actual student details (name, student number, department)
4. **Real-time Data**: Fetches live transcript data from backend when "View Details" is clicked
5. **Loading States**: Clear loading indicators while fetching data
6. **Error Handling**: Graceful error handling with proper logging

## Technical Implementation Details

### Request Details
```typescript
// Request URL pattern
const url = `${apiBaseUrl}/CourseTakens/by-student/${studentId}?PageRequest.PageSize=2147483647`;

// Headers included
Authorization: `Bearer ${authToken}`
Content-Type: application/json

// Student information passed to API
const studentInfo = {
  name: student.name,
  studentNumber: student.studentNumber || student.id,
  department: student.department
};
```

### Data Flow
1. User clicks "View Details" on student card
2. `handleViewDetails(student)` is called with full student object
3. Student information is extracted and passed to transcript API
4. API fetches course data using student's database ID
5. Response is transformed with proper student information
6. Dialog displays student details and course history

### Debug Features
- Comprehensive console logging for debugging API calls
- Request/response status tracking
- Data transformation logging
- Error tracking with detailed messages

## Error Handling
- Network errors are caught and logged
- Authentication errors handled with proper user feedback
- Graceful fallback when transcript data is unavailable
- Service-specific error messages with `ServiceError` class

## Technical Notes
- Reuses existing service infrastructure with mock/API switching
- Follows TypeScript best practices with proper type definitions
- Implements responsive design patterns
- Uses Material-UI components for consistent styling
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing functionality
